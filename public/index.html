            <h3>Coding isn't the only thing I love to do!</h3>
          </hgroup>
          <p>
            Welcome to my website, it's still a work in progress so new things
            will keep on being added. I'm Michael (or Mike, whichever you
            prefer) and I'm in the process of transitioning from the healthcare
            field into software development through a full stack coding bootcamp
            called Tech Elevator. I love spending time outdoors doing things
            like backpacking, skiing, and fishing and having lived in Colorado
            for 10 years I was able to enjoy all of those quite a lot.

          <h3>Why software development?</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout my life I've always had a deep appreciation for learning
            how things work, how they break and most importantly - how to fix
            them. From cars or dirt bikes to computer hardware or software, I've
            used this strength to break down large problems into the indvidual
            parts that make the whole. Over the years, I have gained valuable
            experience in a multitude of roles and industries but one thing that
            always felt like it was missing was the sort of mental stimulation
            that I've found with coding. The process of figuring something out,
            from step one all the way through to a finished product is something
            I've always loved and to be able to do it for a career would be a
            dream come true.
          </p>
          <h3>Where I'm at and where I'm going</h3>
          <p>
            As of 8/18/2023 I'm excited to share that I've graduated from Tech
            Elevator's rigorous Java coding bootcamp. With hundreds of hours
            spent learning vital software engineering skills, I hope to find a
            job at a company that's looking for someone who runs towards the
            difficult problems that no one else wants to touch. I'm a quick
            learner with a talent for solving complex problems efficiently.
            Having spent years in healthcare, I understand the importance of
            precision, attention to detail, and delivering high-quality work.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you, or someone you know, is looking to hire someone with those
            traits as well as a proven track record of dependability and strong
            work ethic you can get in touch with me through the contact info
            listed on my resume. Just click the blue resume button at the top of
            the page. I look forward to hearing from you!

              can enjoy continuous analysis using stockfish, the most powerful
              chess engine to date, for a given position. In this future I hope
              to allow users to play against other people directly on my
